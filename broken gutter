```python
class AIBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threat_patterns = self.load_threat_patterns()
    
    def load_threat_patterns(self):
        # Load known attack patterns from a database or file
        return ["malicious_pattern_1", "malicious_pattern_2"]

    def analyze_traffic(self, traffic):
        for pattern in self.threat_patterns:
            if pattern in traffic:
                self.respond_to_threat(traffic)

    def respond_to_threat(self, traffic):
        # Log the threat and notify the security team
        print("Threat detected! Logging and notifying team.")
        # Optionally, trigger a firewall rule to block the traffic
```

#### 2. Firewall Integration

- Use a firewall API to dynamically add rules based on detected threats.

```python
def block_ip(ip_address):
    # Send a command to the firewall to block the IP address
    print(f"Blocking IP address: {ip_address}")
```

#### 3. Traffic Monitoring

```python
def monitor_network():
    while True:
        traffic = capture_network_traffic()
        ai_bot.analyze_traffic(traffic)
```

const chains = [42161, 8453, 10, 534352, 81457]

for (const chain of chains) {

  // endpoint accepts one chain at a time, loop for all your chains
  const balance = fetch(`https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?
     chainid=${chain}
     &module=account
     &action=balance
     &address=0xb5d85cbf7cb3ee0d56b3bb207d5fc4b82f43f511
     &tag=latest&apikey=YourApiKeyToken`)
     
}
